# Silken Banners

**Silken Banners** is a community-driven strategy game inspired by *Kessen II* and the epic tales of the *Romance of the Three Kingdoms*.  
Set during the turbulent fall of the Han dynasty, it blends large-scale real-time battles with over‑the‑shoulder general combat and narrative-driven encounters.  
Players command armies, embody legendary generals, and shape the fate of kingdoms through both battlefield decisions and story choices.
